# Output Audio Too Quiet? Increase Volume with `ffmpeg`

When working with the MAX98357A audio amplifier, it's easy to assume that quiet output means something is wrong with your wiring, power supply, or even the amp itself. But in reality, one of the most common and overlooked issues is that the digital audio file you're playing simply isn't loud enough. That was exactly the case here: the amp was functioning perfectly, the wiring was sound, and even the gain pin configuration didn’t matter — the real issue was the .wav file being too quiet at the source.

Digital audio has a maximum amplitude defined by 0 dBFS (decibels relative to full scale). Many audio files are mastered well below this threshold, especially system sounds or clips with a lot of headroom. When you send a low-amplitude file to a digital amp like the MAX98357A, it will reproduce that signal faithfully — but quietly. No amount of gain pin fiddling or power tweaks will help if the source signal isn’t pushing the available range.

The solution is simple: use ffmpeg to amplify the audio before playback. A quick command like ffmpeg -i input.wav -filter:a "volume=10dB" output.wav boosts the file by 10 decibels, making it substantially louder without touching any hardware. For more consistent results across multiple files or to avoid clipping, you can use the loudness normalization filter: ffmpeg -i input.wav -af "loudnorm=I=-14:TP=0.0:LRA=11" normalized.wav. This ensures the audio peaks as close as possible to the digital max without distortion. With just this change, the output goes from barely audible to fully usable — no hardware changes needed.

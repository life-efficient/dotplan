ok so i've realised something rather important:
the joint transforms im using traverse from the parent origin to the child origin, but in fact what i believe urdf expects is them to traverse from the origin of the parent JOINT to the child JOINT. The joint origin is considered as the origin of the next part, but in my case, the meshes are not aligned at the joint origin. e.g. the servo case is mounted to the servo at a fixed joint along a random edge, not the origin of the servo case.

So i believe that 
1. the visual/collision needs to have an offset (not 0 0 0) as standard
2. the joint transform needs to be computed as the composed transform of the child placement of the PREVIOUS joint and the parent placement of the CURRENT JOINT. Im saying that the transforms from joint to joint are contained in different joints. the composed transform of the placements of a SINGLE joint will take you from the origin of the previous part to the origin of the next part, not the transform from the previous joint to the next joint

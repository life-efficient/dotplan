Finally, after 8 days of pure grind, I've managed to make a URDF exporter that takes my 3D model assembly and generates a valid URDF file. I explored endless rabbit holes leading to countless dead ends, but finally I think the robot is ready to go to nursery (simulation, where it's actually going to learn something).

I've created a new project called the Dojo where the robots are going to train in simulation. Now going to try to import the URDF and generate some motion control.

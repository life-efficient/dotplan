# 🧠 Debugging Quiet Audio from an I²S Amp on a Raspberry Pi

I wired up a MAX98357A I²S amplifier to my Raspberry Pi Zero and was initially rewarded with loud, crisp sound through a 4Ω 3W speaker. Days later, without touching the wiring, the volume suddenly dropped to barely audible levels—even though the audio was still technically "playing."

The wires were solid. Voltage across VIN, SD, and GAIN was a constant 3.3V. Moving VIN to the 5V GPIO (Pin 2) helped, but volume was still lower than before. Swapping in a new Pi and a fresh amp changed nothing. I even rebooted, shut down properly, checked speaker integrity, played test files, toggled GAIN pin states—nothing fixed it.

Then came the breakthrough.

Running:

```bash
aplay test.wav
```

played the audio, but it was still quiet.

But:

```bash
aplay -D plughw:0,0 test.wav
```

blew the doors off. Full volume returned.

## 🔍 The Root Cause

The default `aplay` command uses ALSA's default device, which may route through software mixers or apply gain scaling—even if your hardware doesn't support it. That includes hidden attenuation. On the other hand, specifying `-D plughw:0,0` bypasses all of that and sends raw audio directly to the I²S DAC.

## ✅ Fix

To avoid this surprise in future, I set the default device explicitly:

Create or edit:

`~/.asoundrc`

Add:

```ini
defaults.pcm.!card 0
defaults.ctl.!card 0
```

Now `aplay test.wav` hits the correct hardware at full volume every time.

## 🧠 Lesson

> If your audio gets mysteriously quiet on a Raspberry Pi setup—check your aplay device. It's not always the wiring. Sometimes, Linux just silently decides to downscale your sound.

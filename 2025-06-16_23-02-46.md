# 🧾 What I Did to Get I²S Audio Working on My Pi Zero

I connected a MAX98357A digital amplifier to my Raspberry Pi Zero using the I²S protocol and got proper speaker output through a 4Ω 3W speaker. Here's exactly what I did and what I learned.

## ⚙️ Hardware Wiring

| MAX98357A Pin | Connected To                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| VIN          | Shared 5V VCC rail                  |
| GND          | Shared GND rail                     |
| BCLK         | GPIO18 (Pin 12)                     |
| LRCLK        | GPIO19 (Pin 35)                     |
| DIN          | GPIO21 (Pin 40)                     |
| SD           | VCC (or GPIO for mute control)      |
| + / −        | Speaker terminals                   |

> **Note:** At first, I mistakenly connected DIN to Pin 21 (GPIO9), which caused the amp to chirp with random garbage every ~22 seconds. I fixed this by moving it to Pin 40 (GPIO21) or alternatively using Pin 38 (GPIO20) with a config override.

## 📂 Pi Configuration

I edited `/boot/firmware/config.txt` (not `/boot/config.txt`, which is now just a redirect), and added:

```ini
dtparam=i2s=on
dtoverlay=hifiberry-dac
```

I also commented out or removed this line to avoid conflicts with the analog/HDMI sound drivers:

```ini
# dtparam=audio=on
```

Without that, the Pi's default audio doesn't interfere with the I²S DAC.

## 🔊 Playback

I installed `sox`, then created a stereo test file from the default mono clip:

```bash
sox /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav test.wav remix - remix -
```

Then I played it using:

```bash
aplay -D plughw:0,0 -f S16_LE -r 44100 -c 2 test.wav
```

I confirmed the setup using:

```bash
speaker-test -D plughw:0,0 -c 2 -r 44100 -t wav
```

## 🐞 Chirping Issue and Fix

The amp was chirping every ~22 seconds while idle. I found this was due to the Pi sending periodic I²S data or resets. To silence it completely between plays, I:

- Connected the SD pin on the amp to a GPIO pin (e.g. GPIO17)
- Wrote Python code to toggle SD high before playback, and low afterward

This cleanly mutes the amp when not in use.

Now I've got clean, digital audio playback through the MAX98357A on my Pi Zero, I understand the I²S pin requirements, and I know how to suppress unwanted noise when idle.

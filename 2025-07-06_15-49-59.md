- clone a github repo into the FreeCAD/Mod directory to have it show up in FreeCAD's workbench list
- FreeCAD's Assembly4 is pretty good - it automatically creates local coordinate systems based on selected geometry which can be mated to any other generated LCS - there's certainly a possiblity that you could have an AI agent do the mating for you
- the freecad mcp has a lot of potential (although it seems to throw errors when returning model screenshots)
- trick to force stdout to show in freecad python console "code": "import FreeCAD\nFreeCAD.Console.PrintMessage('Hello, world!\\n')"
- perhaps there's a way to use the MCP to create a non-technical interface for modeling with freecad, especially if focused on a particular domain like my robots, or particular workflows like customising existing parts of the standard kit
- increasingly intelligent models could let you ride the wave of AI applied to design with FreeCAD

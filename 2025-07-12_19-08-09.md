- Major joke - urdf transformations are applied in a different order than 4x4 transformation matrices. URDF transformations apply translation first, then rotation (R (p + T)). Transformation matrices apply Rp + T. I thought this was a major fuckup I'd made, but it turns out that the freecad placements also define transformations in this way. Regardless, worth knowing.
- Watch out for how euler angles can represent rotations differently due to gimbal lock

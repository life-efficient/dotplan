- Setting the servo gain and derivative avoids excessive current draw which can cause brownouts on the pi when all motors are set to torque
- Improvement could be made to the wiring of the feet to detect toe and heel contact separately - currently they're wired together and either toe or heel will trigger the contact detection
- Like anything with a strong current, motors running near an IMU can change the magnetic environment. Because of this, the calibration of the IMU might need correcting between motors on/off

Gyroscope (G): keep the board perfectly still until you see the G-value go to 3.

Accelerometer (A): place the board flat on each of its six faces, holding each orientation still so the A-value increments up to 3.

Magnetometer (M): wave the board through a “figure-8” motion in all three dimensions until the M-value climbs to 3.

System (S): once G, A and M are 3, the system S will automatically move to 3.

Keep an eye on the printed tuple and only move on when each component hits 3.

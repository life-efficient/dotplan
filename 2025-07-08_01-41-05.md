I Spent All Day Debugging FreeCAD-to-URDF Joint Transforms—And I’m Still Stuck
If you’ve ever tried to export a robot assembly from FreeCAD to URDF and found your parts flipped, misplaced, or scaled wrong, you’re not alone. I just spent an entire day wrestling with this, and despite trying every trick in the book, I’m still not at a working solution. Here’s what I learned, what I tried, and why this problem is so stubborn.
The Problem: “Why Is My Robot Flipped, Shifted, or Tiny?”
My robot looks almost correct in the URDF visualizer, but some parts are reversed, others are offset by weird amounts, and the scale is totally off.
Every time I fix one thing, something else breaks.
What I Tried (and Why It Didn’t Work)
Matrix Math:
Used the classic parent_placement * inverse(child_placement) formula. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doubles the error or flips the part.
Translation Difference:
Tried both parent - child and child - parent. Each fixes one thing and breaks another.
Axis Flipping:
Detected and flipped mirrored axes. Sometimes this helps, sometimes it just rotates the part upside down.
Scaling:
Switched between mm and meters, but always ended up with values 1000x too big or too small.
What I Learned
Placements are tricky:
FreeCAD’s placements are not always what you think. Sometimes they’re from origin to joint, sometimes not.
Order and sign matter:
Get it wrong, and your robot is inside out.
Scaling is a minefield:
If you don’t know your units, you’re doomed to repeat the same mistake over and over.
There’s no “one size fits all” formula:
Every assembly, every joint, every CAD export can be different.
The Reality: Still Stuck
After a full day of debugging, logging, and patching, I still don’t have a robust, general solution.
Sometimes the translation is right, but the rotation is wrong. Sometimes the scale is right, but the placement is off.
The only thing that’s consistent is that this is hard.

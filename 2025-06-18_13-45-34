# üß† Setting Up a Headless Pi Zero Over USB and Hotspot ‚Äî The Actual Process

I wanted to set up a Raspberry Pi Zero with no monitor, no keyboard, no Ethernet ‚Äî just a USB cable and SSH access. The goal was to connect via cable first, then get it onto my phone's hotspot for wireless SSH.

It turned out to be way more fragile than expected.

## ‚úÖ The Intended Plan

1. Plug Pi Zero into my Mac via USB (data port)
2. Enable USB Ethernet with `g_ether`
3. SSH into the Pi over cable
4. Set up Wi-Fi from there

## ‚ùå What Went Wrong

I edited `cmdline.txt` and `config.txt` correctly:

```lua
rootwait modules-load=dwc2,g_ether
dtoverlay=dwc2
```

- Used a known-good data cable
- Plugged into the correct port
- Still, nothing showed up on the Mac. No USB Ethernet, no IP, no response.

I added a script (`configure_network.sh`) with `init=/boot/configure_network.sh` in `cmdline.txt` to assign a static IP on boot. That got ignored ‚Äî turns out systemd doesn't respect `init=` unless you're replacing the entire init process. Not happening.

Eventually the SD card corrupted and I couldn't even mount the boot volume anymore. So I started from scratch.

## üßº What Worked

- Reflashed with Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit)
- Used Raspberry Pi Imager's advanced config (press Ctrl+Shift+X)
- Set:
  - Hostname: `pi-01`
  - Enabled SSH
  - Wi-Fi SSID: `YOUR HOTSPOT NAME`
  - Password: `YOUR HOTSPOT PASSWORD`
  - Country: `SA`

The Pi still didn't connect ‚Äî until I enabled "Maximize Compatibility" on my iPhone hotspot. That forces 2.4GHz, which the Pi Zero needs.

After that, green LED blinked continuously, and I SSH'd in instantly:

```bash
ssh pi@pi-01.local
```

## üß† Notes from the Process

- `.local` only works if your Mac and Pi are on the same network
- The Pi keeps trying Wi-Fi indefinitely ‚Äî blinking green LED = it's alive
- `init=` doesn't work with systemd, don't waste time there
- If your Mac doesn't see the Pi at all over USB, `g_ether` probably never loaded ‚Äî likely due to 64-bit OS or a missed config step
- If the boot partition won't mount and `ls` returns garbage, your SD is toast

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Automate the setup across multiple Pis
- Get USB fallback working with `rc.local`

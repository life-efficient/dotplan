- Shaving my head signals the start of a new era - the blonde is gone, at least until I get somewhere I trust them to dye it.
- Merged together the separate github repo for robot reference motion generation and control policy training. This will help me to share utilities between the two (like packing and unpacking the reference motion with the right columns).
- The next step is to debug why I cant see the trunk/feet frames for D2 in the generated reference motion. My suspicion is that the URDF is scaled by 1000x due to mm to m conversion. Further convinced by the 7 order magnitude difference between the plotted range of the playback motion.

- Finally got the walking reference motion generator working for D2. The previous issue was "hopping" motion generated where the robot stays in a fixed pose but its trunk is moved. The issue was that my gait generation parameters included joint positions that were overriding the computed joint angles during the gait generation, whereas I should have just been fixing the joints unused during walking (e.g. facial expressions or head positions)

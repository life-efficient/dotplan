- for calculating the right transform from child to parent through a joint, do parent_origin_to_joint @ inverse(child_origin_to_joint)
- however, this assumes that the orientation (and translation) of the joint is exactly the same for both parent and joint - which is not necessarily correct 
- the result of this is that parts may be flipped and translations added rather than subtracted
- one fix to this is to ensure that you only mate joint locations that are identically oriented
- is there another fix where you transform one joint to the other? yes, probably
- however, is it just special cases where this applies?

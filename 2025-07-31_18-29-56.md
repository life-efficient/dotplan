- Mujoco can throw lots of issues by indexing joints or degrees of freedom by index. A reason I found for this is because it may introduce 6 DOF for a free body (xyz, rpy) and none of these correspond to a controllable joint. If you're not careful you might be getting/setting the wrong values during logging or control.

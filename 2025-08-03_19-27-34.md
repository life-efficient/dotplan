- Today i made some improvements to my modular hinge joint design to make the two links look more connected by adding matching circular geometries. Better now they dont look so square
- Simply put, the robots are not fighting because they 1) cannot stay standing up 2) they cant be controlled. If I can fix these two things, I can get them fighting. That means 1) training the walking control policy and 2) implementing pose estimation as teleoperation. There are potentially simpler ways to get them fighting, like just telling fixing the trunk height and orientation, and then getting to run towards each other, but these are probably short-sighted goals with no extensibility.

- Design and construct outwards - it makes assembly easier/possible
- When designing, leave bolt (and bolt head) holes until last, and fillet and chamfer everything just before that
- Vibration matters! Today I was walking my robot and then saw it starting to do something that looked like the splits - one of the legs was right out sideways. I assumed the motor had failed, but when I looked I saw that one of the bolts attaching the leg to the servo had come out! Always keep your tools with you if you're out with the robot (like you keep a spare wheel in your car), especially if you're showing it off to anyone. You don't want to be caught with a problem and be unable to fix it.
- Don't expect a robot control policy to work on a robot that's missing pieces. It's policy is trained to account for the weights and inertia of every component, so they can't just be missing when it comes to putting what it learnt into practice.

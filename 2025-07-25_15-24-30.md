- Fixed the scaling of my robot so that it doesn't produce a 500m tall robot
- Lots of robot files (e.g. URDFs) were previously duplicated for 1) reference motion generation and 2) training / visualisation. I've recently combined them so that all robot-specific files are in the same dir (e.g. URDFs, meshes, gait parameters, mujoco scenes)
- I've made the code that visualises each robot with controls into a single file, I can view the reference motion generated for my test robot perfectly, but its not yet working for my robot designed from scratch. I think I can handle this today - that's a huge milestone because it means that worst case scenario - the generated gait can be deployed to the robot with no additional training - its gonna fall over and not realise, but at least it will be better than no motion or random motion.

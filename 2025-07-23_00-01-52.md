- I've got two repos - one for generating reference motion for the robot using placo, and one for training the robot in mujoco, and they share data, such as the coefficients of the polynomials - generated by one repo to fit to the reference motion trajectory and consumed by another to compute an imitation reward. Both repos need to do similar things, like understand what keys of the coefficients correspond to which robot joints. It seems like it would be a good idea to merge the repos together.

# ‚úÖ Working Setup: Google VoiceHAT (Mic + Speaker)

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup

Edit `/boot/firmware/config.txt` (or `/boot/config.txt`):

```ini
[all]
dtparam=audio=off
dtoverlay=googlevoicehat-soundcard
```

Remove or comment out conflicting overlays (this is where I screwed up):

```ini
# dtoverlay=hifiberry-dac
```

Reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Verify both devices show up:

```bash
arecord -l   # check mic
aplay -l     # check speaker
```

You should see one card:

```
card 0: sndrpigooglevoi [snd_rpi_googlevoicehat_soundcar]
```

Test mic recording:

```bash
arecord -D plughw:0,0 -f cd -t wav -d 5 test.wav
```

Test playback:

```bash
aplay -D plughw:0,0 test.wav
```

Live mic-to-speaker loop (full pipeline test):

```bash
arecord -D plughw:0,0 -f cd | aplay -D plughw:0,0
```

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes (that I made)

- Using multiple I2S overlays like `hifiberry-dac` at the same time as `googlevoicehat-soundcard` ‚Üí causes hardware conflict.
- Trying to use weird device names like `sysdefault:CARD=sndrpigooglevoi` ‚Üí just use `plughw:0,0`.
- Not checking the mic disappeared after rewiring ‚Äî likely caused a short or I2S init failure, fixed by removing DAC conflict + rebooting.
- Recording with wrong format (e.g. 32-bit mono) then trying to play it on a setup expecting 16-bit stereo ‚Üí results in silence.

## üéØ Final Notes

- `plughw:0,0` works for both mic and speaker.
- Use `-f cd` for standard 16-bit/44.1kHz/stereo compatibility.
- Don't touch PulseAudio or other junk unless you know what you're doing.

This config is now solid. Time to build something with it.

##  What I Learnt Today – Servo Power, Brownouts, and Soldering Realities

- Turns out **28AWG wires are useless** for powering 10 servos in series. Way too thin. Massive voltage drop, everything freaks out.
- When that happens, you get **brownouts**. My Pi kept restarting—classic sign you're drawing more current than the system can handle.
- Not all USB-C chargers are equal. Some just don’t power MB045 chips properly. Could be due to **invalid voltage negotiation**. Worth checking datasheets or just trying a different charger.
- Lesson: **triple check all your connections**. Today I wasted time debugging just because I’d left the power switch off and hadn’t connected the Pi to the servo bus via the USB-C to micro-USB jumper.
- **Soldering thick wires sucks** unless you crank up the iron heat. If cranking doesn’t help, a dab of flux works wonders. It helps the solder flow and grip the strands.
- Pro tip: when soldering XT30 connectors, **always plug them into the opposite connector** while soldering. It stops the pins from getting hot and melting through the housing.
